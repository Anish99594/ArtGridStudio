## üåü Project Overview

ArtGrid Studio is a **decentralized NFT marketplace** that introduces a unique **tiered progression system**. Unlike traditional NFTs, our platform allows NFTs to evolve through **likes**, **comments**, and **LYX staking**, unlocking higher-quality versions and exclusive content as engagement grows. Key features include:

- **Multi-Tiered NFTs**: Each NFT has multiple tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) with increasing requirements for likes, comments, and LYX stakes.
- **Engagement-Driven Progression**: Collectors can interact with NFTs to unlock new tiers, enhancing value and exclusivity.
- **Google Drive Integration**: Metadata and images are securely stored on Google Drive, ensuring accessibility and scalability.
- **Intuitive UI/UX**: A sleek React-based frontend with Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion animations, and Wagmi hooks for a seamless experience.
- **LUKSO Blockchain**: Leverages the LUKSO network for low-cost, scalable, and creator-friendly transactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

ArtGrid Studio is built with a robust and modern tech stack to ensure scalability, security, and developer-friendliness:

## üß± System Architecture

Here's a high-level architecture diagram of **ArtGrid Studio** showing how different components interact across the system:

![ArtGrid Studio Architecture](frontend/public/ArchitectureDiagrameArtGridStudio.png)

### Components Overview:
- **Frontend**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Connects to smart contracts and fetches metadata.
- **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on the LUKSO testnet using Solidity and Hardhat, implementing LSP8 for tiered NFTs.
- **Google Drive + Cloudflare Workers**: Off-chain storage for NFT metadata and media with fast, proxied access.
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens ensure secure API requests from the frontend to backend services.
- **LUKSO Blockchain**: Handles minting, engagement tracking, and staking with low-cost and scalable transactions.

### Backend (Smart Contracts)
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts written in Solidity (^0.8.15) for secure and reliable NFT functionality.
- **LUKSO LSP Standards**: Utilizes LSP8IdentifiableDigitalAsset for advanced NFT features.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Incorporates battle-tested contracts for security (`ReentrancyGuard`, `Pausable`).
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts.

### Frontend
- **React**: A fast and modular frontend built with React for dynamic UI components.
- **Wagmi**: Web3 hooks for seamless blockchain interactions (e.g., `useReadContract`, `useWriteContract`).
- **RainbowKit**: Wallet connection library for a smooth user onboarding experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern styling.
- **Framer Motion**: Animations for engaging transitions and micro-interactions.
- **P-Queue**: Manages concurrent metadata fetching to optimize performance.
- **Jose**: JWT generation for secure API authentication.

### Infrastructure
- **Google Drive API**: Stores NFT metadata and images securely with shareable links.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Proxy service for fetching and caching Google Drive content.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool for the frontend.
- **Pyodide**: (Optional) For potential future integrations with Python-based analytics.

### Development Tools
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Ensures code quality and consistency.
- **Vercel**: (Optional) For easy frontend deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
